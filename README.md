# Weapon Workshop GTA 5

## Overview

This is a script mod for GTA 5 written in C# using ScriptHookV.NET and LemonUI libraries.

The script spawns a chest at a small salvage yard in southern Los Santos. The chest has weapons the player can take and a blip on the map.
The weapon selection in the chest weapons menu is randomized and it changes every 15 minutes, so in the GTA world chest is "resupplied" every 7.5 hours.

Overall this a lore-friendly GTA 5 mod and also it is heavily inspired by Emmet's workshop from GTA San Andreas. This is great especially for role playing, realism, gangster life etc.
