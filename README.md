# Weapon Workshop GTA 5

## Overview

This is a script mod for GTA 5 written in C# using ScriptHookV.NET and LemonUI libraries.

The script spawns a chest at a small salvage yard in southern Los Santos. The chest has weapons the player can take and a blip on the map.
The weapons inside the chest are randomized (pool size: 3-5 weapons) and the selection changes every 15 minutes.

Overall this a lore-friendly GTA 5 mod heavily inspired by Emmet's workshop from GTA San Andreas. This is great especially for role playing, realism, gangster life etc.
